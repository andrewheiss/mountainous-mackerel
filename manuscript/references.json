  {"id":"AbbottKeohaneMoravcsik:2000","abstract":"We develop an empirically based conception of international legalization to show how law and politics are intertwined across a wide range of institutional forms and to frame the analytic and empirical articles that follow in this volume. International legalization is a form of institutionalization characterized by three dimensions: obligation, precision, and delegation. Obligation means that states are legally bound by rules or commitments and therefore subject to the general rules and procedures of international law. Precision means that the rules are definite, unambiguously defining the conduct they require, authorize, or proscribe. Delegation grants authority to third parties for the implementation of rules, including their interpretation and application, dispute settlement, and (possibly) further rule making. These dimensions are conceptually independent, and each is a matter of degree and gradation. Their various combinations produce a remarkable variety of international legalization. We illustrate a continuum ranging from “hard” legalization (characteristically associated with domestic legal systems) through various forms of “soft” legalization to situations where law is largely absent. Most international legalization lies between the extremes, where actors combine and invoke varying degrees of obligation, precision, and delegation to create subtle blends of politics and law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbott","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Keohane","given":"Robert O."},{"family":"Moravcsik","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Slaughter","given":"Anne-Marie"},{"family":"Snidal","given":"Duncan"}],"citation-key":"AbbottKeohaneMoravcsik:2000","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int.

  {"id":"BellBhasinClay:2014","abstract":"This article examines how human rights international non-governmental organizations (hereafter HROs) can increase the level of political protest in neighboring states. Previous research suggests local activities of HROs help to generate mobilization for protests against governments. This article shows that the presence of HROs in neighboring states can be a substitute for domestic HROs; if domestic HROs are already flourishing, there will be less of a ‘neighbor’ effect. At sufficiently high levels of domestic HRO prevalence within a state, neighboring HROs help domestic HROs use institutionalized substitutes for protest mobilization strategies. Spatial econometric methods are used to test the implications of this theory. These results illuminate the role that non-governmental organizations play in these domestic political processes, and demonstrate the transnational nature of their activities.","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Sam R."},{"family":"Bhasin","given":"Tavishi"},{"family":"Clay","given":"K.

  {"id":"Bermeo:2016","abstract":"Democratic backsliding (meaning the state-led debilitation or elimination of the political institutions sustaining an existing democracy) has changed dramatically since the Cold War. Open-ended coups d’état, executive coups, and blatant election-day vote fraud are declining while promissory coups, executive aggrandizement and strategic electoral manipulation and harassment are increasing. Contemporary forms of backsliding are especially vexing because they are legitimated by the very institutions democracy promoters prioritize but, overall, backsliding today reflects democracy’s advance and not its retreat. The current mix of backsliding is more easily reversible than the past mix and successor dictatorships are shorter-lived and less authoritarian.","author":[{"family":"Bermeo","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"Bermeo:2016","container-title":"Journal of Democracy","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"BloodgoodTremblay-Boire:2017","abstract":"Prior work suggests that government funding can encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to engage in political advocacy and public policy. We challenge this finding and examine two theoretical explanations for the dampening effect of government funding on NGO lobbying. First, donors are known to discipline NGO activity via an implicit or explicit threat to withdraw funding should the organization become too radical or political. Second, NGOs with more radical political agendas are less willing to seek or accept government funding for fear this will limit or delegitimize their activities. Using data from the European Union’s Transparency Register, we find that the share of government funding in NGO budgets is negatively associated with lobbying expenditure. This effect is statistically significant and substantial, which provides a reason for concern about NGO resource dependence. Even when governments are motivated by honorable intentions, their financial assistance has the (unintended) effect of dampening NGOs’ political activity.","author":[{"family":"Bloodgood","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Tremblay-Boire","given":"Joannie"}],"citation-key":"BloodgoodTremblay-Boire:2017","container-title":"European Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Eur.

  {"id":"Cole:2015","abstract":"Abstract\n            According to recent studies, international human rights treaties are ineffective, counterproductive, or else beneficial for only those countries that tend to respect human rights regardless of treaty membership. Analysts often attribute gaps between human rights principles and practices to willful disobedience, self-interested defection, and ineffective enforcement. Using two-stage regression models to analyze compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, I examine whether countries' inability (as opposed to unwillingness) to implement treaty terms is also responsible for the gap between commitment and compliance. I find that one dimension of state capacity in particular—bureaucratic efficacy—enhances levels of compliance with civil, political, and physical integrity rights provisions. These findings lend credence to an important aspect of the managerial approach—that noncompliance is often inadvertent and conditioned by a state's ability to implement treaty terms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Wade M."}],"citation-key":"Cole:2015","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int.

  {"id":"Comstock:2021","abstract":"International treaties are the primary means for codifying global human rights standards. However, nation-states are able to make their own choices in how to legally commit to human rights treaties. A state commits to a treaty through four commitment acts: signature, ratification, accession, and succession. These acts signify diverging legal paths with distinct contexts and mechanisms for rights change reflecting legalization, negotiation, sovereignty, and domestic constraints. How a state moves through these actions determines how, when, and to what extent it will comply with the human rights treaties it commits to. Using legal, archival, and quantitative analysis this important book shows that disentangling legal paths to commitment reveals distinct and significant compliance outcomes. Legal context matters for human rights and has important implications for the conceptualization of treaty commitment, the consideration of non-binding commitment, and an optimistic outlook for the impact of human rights treaties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Comstock","given":"Audrey L."}],"citation-key":"Comstock:2021","DOI":"10.1017/9781108908979","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-108-90897-9 978-1-108-83007-2 978-1-108-82158-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,28]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Committed to rights: UN human rights treaties and legal paths for commitment and compliance","title-short":"Committed to Rights","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108908979/type/book"},

  {"id":"SimmonsHopkins:2005","abstract":"We acknowledge the contribution of von Stein (2005) in calling attention to the very real problem of selection bias in estimating treaty effects. Nonetheless, we dispute both von Stein's theoretical and empirical conclusions. Theoretically, we contend that treaties can both screen and constrain simultaneously, meaning that findings of screening do nothing to undermine the claim that treaties constrain state behavior as well. Empirically, we question von Stein's estimator on several grounds, including its strong distributional assumptions and its statistical inconsistency. We then illustrate that selection bias does not account for much of the difference between Simmons's (2000) and von Stein's (2005) estimated treaty effects, and instead reframe the problem as one of model dependency. Using a preprocessing matching step to reduce that dependency, we then illustrate treaty effects that are both substantively and statistically significant—and that are quite close in magnitude to those reported by Simmons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Simmons","given":"Beth A."},{"family":"Hopkins","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"SimmonsHopkins:2005","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am.

  {"id":"SingerWillett:2003","abstract":"Abstract\n            Change is constant in everyday life. Infants crawl and then walk, children learn to read and write, teenagers mature in myriad ways, and the elderly become frail and forgetful. Beyond these natural processes and events, external forces and interventions instigate and disrupt change: test scores may rise after a coaching course, drug abusers may remain abstinent after residential treatment. By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. This book is concerned with behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. It offers a presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using data sets from published studies, the book takes you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Judith D."},{"family":"Willett","given":"John B."}],"citation-key":"SingerWillett:2003","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195152968.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-515296-8 978-0-19-986498-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",5,8]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurrence","title-short":"Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/41753"},

First, because the data constitute all the available observations from a population, conventional inference based on the long-run behavior of a repeatable data mechanism is not appropriate. Second, the small and collinear data sets of comparative research yield imprecise estimates of the effects of explanatory variables. We describe a Bayesian approach to statistical inference that provides a unified solution to these two problems. This approach is illustrated in a comparative analysis of unionization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Western","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"WesternJackman:1994","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am.
