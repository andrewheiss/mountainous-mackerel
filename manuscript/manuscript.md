Combating a deadly virus like SARS-CoV-2 requires extraordinary public health
measures. In an effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world imposed restrictions
on the freedom of movement, association, assembly, privacy. While countries are ostensibly free to instate these policies within their own borders, they also raise important questions regarding states' commitments to international human rights principles. Many international human rights treaties recognize states' needs for emergency health measures that may infringe on human rights, but contain provisions fo doing so while establishing crucial safeguards to prevent permanent erosion of these rights. This temporary suspension of complying with international treaty provisions occurs through a process known as derogogations. However, the abuse of emergency derogations by many governments during the pandemic raises concerns about the long-lasting impact of these measures on human rights. 

Existing literature on emergencies such as wars and natural disasters shows that civil society organizations can play a pivotal role during these periods. They can provide services and resources, and can help organize and monitor both the public and the government responses to these emergencies. Can it also prevent or reduce the likelihood of human rights violations during these periods of emergency? Does a robust civil society mitigate the adverse effects arising from international treaty derogations during the pandemic?

Why should we care
Studying state compliance with the international human rights treaty obligations as well as the (unintended) effects of derogations is important given trends in democratic backsliding and declining respect for human rights. Nearly 75 percent of the world’s population now lives in a country that faced democratic deterioration last year. How it's gotten worse during the pandemic. While derogations are intended to make sure these measures are temporary, proportional and non-discriminatory, many do not end up being so owing to the lack of review from the international community. In this scenario, when international factors may not constrain state actions, assessing which domestic-level factors can mitigate the adverse effects of derogations becomes essential. These periods of emergencies may be an important piece to understand the processes of autocratization and democratic backsliding since they often allow states to mut dissent and centralize authority (Luhrmann and Rooney)

Second, there is a robust literature on compliance with international law and how it can lead to improvements in domestic human rights conditions. But we know much less about how such international treaties and provisions intended to safeguard rights can actually worse human rights outcomes. 

What do we do
Previous literature finds that an effective civil society response can mitigate the impact of natural disasters and crises and even increase political engagement in the long-run. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy PanDem dataset, the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker and the CoronaNet Covid-19 Government Response Event, we first assess the variation in human rights responses among governments during the pandemic. We then assess the role of civil society in keeping governments accountable and mitigating the effects of policies that violate human rights.

#Emergency measures and human rights responses


Derogations in international law authorize states to temporarily suspend their international treaty commitments during times of crises, providing them with flexibility in responding to national crises. These times of crises including wars, natural disasters, internal political unrest such as terrorism, and public health emergencies.

Derogations afford states the opportunity to adjust to changing conditions (Hafner-Burton, Helfer, and Fariss 2011).  Even legal critical assessments of the use of derogations (e.g., Richardson and Devine 2021) find importance in their use arguing that, "When a state does not bother with derogation provisions in times of emergencies where human rights are suspended, then it is a situation of unbridled state power.” (Burchill 2005:97) Derogations thus provide vital information to both international and domestic monitoring bodies, interest groups, and advocates about which rights are suspended, for how long, and the reasoning behind these suspensions. This information allows these actors—at least in principle—to challenge measures that are excessive, vague, or outlast the intended time frame of their implementation (Helfer 2021). 

Derogations during the pandemic + Intro focus on ICCPR
The exceptional circumstances brought on by the global pandemic have led to numerous extensive derogations. In this paper, we focus on derogations from—and violations of—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), arguably the most significant and extensive treaties in the international human rights regime. The ICCPR was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 19, 1966 and came into force on March 23, 1976. It was designed to recognize “the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family” and it outlined dozens of articles aimed at creating conditions where everyone can enjoy their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Like other human rights treaties, the ICCPR allows the suspension or derogation of certain civil and political rights only under specific situations “public emergency which threatens the life of the nation” (“International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights” 1976). Write how it accommodates public health measures. 


Difference between derogable and non-derogable rights
To officially derogate,  government must first officially declare a state of emergency (Article 4). These derogations must fulfil three criteria: they should be temporary in application, proportional to a crisis' actual threat and non-discriminatory. However, it is worth noting that states cannot derogate from the entirety of the ICCPR. Seven rights as enshrined in the ICCPR are non-derogable: right to life (article 6), freedom from torture or cruel, inhumane punishment (article 7), freedom from slavry (article 8), freedom of thought, conscience and religion (article 18) and which others??

Five articles of the ICCPR provide tht public health needs can justify limitations on the rights articulated by the articles (Richardson and Devine 2021, 112)--freedom of movement (article 12), freedom of expression (article 19), right to peaceful assembly (article 21) and right to freedom of association (article 22).  

However, statistical analyses find that finds that there is no meaningful variation patterns based on derogable vs non-derogable (Richards and Clay 2012; Neumayer 2013).  Studies find that some states that derogate are more likely to violate physical integrity rights, which are non-derogable rights (Neumayer 2013; Comstock 2019). This suggests that states may not be discerning the significance or derogable/non-derogable rights status during emergencies. This also raises the question on the extnt to which this distinction is a valuable one during the pandemic--a public health emergency different from other states of emerency normally brought on by war or internal political unrest. Though there is a general expectation that following derogations there will be some observable decline in respect for human rights.  Greene(2020) argues that the failure to derogate in emergency situations can actually contribute to violations “as a result of insistence on business as usual” leading to “egregious constitutional abuses” (3). 

Whil existing literture focuses on the characteristics of countries that violate both derogable and non-derogable rights during emergencies, we have yet no systematic evidence on factors that may safeguard against these rights violations during periods of derogation. 

#Role of civil society

There is a robust literature on how civil society is important for improving human rights outcomes.
- Democratic transition and consolidation
- Mobilize public opinion
- Monitors state behavior, violations etc
- Input in policymaking process - represents public opinion

The impact of emergencies is expected to have longer term impacts beyond temporary human rights violations and on democratic decline after the emergencies are over (Lührmann and Rooney 2021). 

> **Hypothesis 1a**: If states formally derogate from international treaty provisions (ICCPR data), then they are less likely to use discriminatory policy measures during the pandemic.
> **Hypothesis 1b**: If states formally derogate from international treaty provisions, then they are less likely to violate non-derogable rights
> **Hypothesis 1c**: If states formally derogate from international treaty provisions, then they are less likely to impose measures with no time limits.


> **Hypothesis 2a**: If states are repressive towards civil society organizations (v-dem), then they are more likely to violate non-derogable rights.
> **Hypothesis 2b**: If states are repressive towards civil society organizations, then they are more likely to use discriminatory policy measures during the pandemic.
> **Hypothesis 2c**: If states are repressive towards civil society organizations, then they are more likely to engage in abusive enforcement of measures instated to deal with the pandemic.
> **Hypothesis 2d**: If states are repressive towards civil society organizations, then they are more likely to impose limits on media freedom.

 

> **Hypothesis 3a**: If civil society organizations are involved in the policy making process and consulted by the government (v-dem for both), then states are more likely to have supportive economic policies during the pandemic.
> **Hypothesis 3b**: If states formally derogate from their international treaty provisions, then states are more likely to have supportive economic policies during the pandemic.

#Analysis


#Discussion

Lebret (2020) argued that derogations are the best legal mechanism for states to notify the global community of their inability to comply with human rights standards during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Richardson and Devine (2021) see derogations as a less clear path for states during COVID-19, describing the actions, their conditions, and human rights as a “tangled morass”(106).
