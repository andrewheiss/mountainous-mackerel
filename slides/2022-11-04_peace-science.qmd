# Question {background-color="`r clrs[3]`" .white}

##

![](img/covid-headlines@3x.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}


## Emergencies and international law {.clrs-3}

### Derogations

Provisions in international law that authorize states to temporarily suspend treaty obligations

. . .

Many states do not formally derogate and just implement emergency measures


## ICCPR derogations during COVID-19 {.clrs-3}

## Research questions {.clrs-3}

::: {.incremental}
- Were derogating states less likely to abuse human rights as they implemented emergency measures for COVID-19?
- Can civil society organizations (CSOs) mitigate the adverse effects of these emergency measures?
:::


## Preview of findings {.clrs-3}

Derogating states are less likely to abuse emergency measures, have discriminatory policies, violate non-derogable rights, and impose measures without time limits

. . .

Permissive civil society environment increases likelihood of debt relief policies

. . .

Civil society repression increases the probability of abusive enforcement and discriminatory policies; derogations mitigate that probability


## Significance {.clrs-3}

**International law and human rights**

International treaty provisions designed to safeguard rights may end up worsening conditions when there is a lack of review from the international community

. . .

**Democratic erosion and human rights**

Emergencies are important for understanding the processes of autocratization and democratic backsliding


# Theory and hypotheses {background-color="`r clrs[5]`" .white}

## UN requirements for public health emergency measures {.clrs-5}

Suspensions of rights must be:

- Legal
- Necessary
- Proportional
- Non-discriminatory


## Derogations during COVID-19 {.clrs-5}

#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 5
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-align: center
wrap_plots(preliminary_models_plots$pred_plot)
```


## Pandemic as excuse {.clrs-5}

If states implement emergency measures without regard for international law, the implementation may be problematic and the process to restore rights may not be followed

- Restrictions on travel or movement by minority or opposition groups
- Limits on public assembly and protests
- Deployment of surveillance systems that impede privacy


## H~1~: Derogations & human rights {.clrs-5}

If states formally derogate from international treaty provisions, then they are less likely to:

a. Use discriminatory policy measures
b. Violate non-derogable rights
c. Impose measures with no time limits


## Civil society and human rights {.clrs-5}

Civil society helps mitigate the impact of crises, emergencies, and natural disasters

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .smallest}
During COVID-19, civil society:

- Broadened range of voices in policymaking process
- Pursued civic initiatives to deal with impact of economic shutdown, product shortages, and spikes in unemployment
- Assisted with public health initiatives

## H~2~: Civil society & supportive policies {.clrs-5}

If civil society organizations are involved in the policy making process, then states are more likely to have supportive economic policies


## Pandemic as excuse {.clrs-5}

Some states used emergency measures as an excuse to limit democratic participation, dissent, and challenges to economic and political rule

## H~3~: Civil society & human rights {.clrs-5}

If states are repressive towards civil society organizations, then they are more likely to:

a. Violate non-derogable rights
b. Use discriminatory policy measures
c. Engage in abusive enforcement of emergency measures
d. Impose limits on media freedom

### Null results

No derogation-based difference in predicted probability of violating non-derogable rights or limiting media across range of civil society repression


# Discussion {background-color="`r clrs[8]`" .white}

## Summary {.clrs-8}

Derogating states are less likely to abuse emergency measures, have discriminatory policies, violate non-derogable rights, and impose measures without time limits

. . .

Civil society repression increases the probability of abusive enforcement and discriminatory policies; derogations mitigate that probability

. . .

Permissive civil society environment increases likelihood of debt relief policies
