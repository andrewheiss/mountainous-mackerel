### 🏔️🐟: Note on “mountainous mackerel” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = "covid and ngos", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "mountainous mackerel"
```
